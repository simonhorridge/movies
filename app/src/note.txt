 

We’d like you to write a small application to allow users to browse a list of films and view detail for each film. 
 We’d like you to use a javascript application framework/library to do this.  
 Your app should include a service that will be used to retrieve film data.  
 The service can consume a simple json file for now but it should be easy to swap in the url of a rest service in the future. 
  For each film we’d like a title, description and an image url.  
  You could use http://www.imdb.com/chart/top for inspiration for choosing some films, six titles should be plenty.  
  Pages should be wireframes rather than fully featured graphic designs though we expect the layouts to work on mobile devices.

 

We’d like your code to be source controlled and your local repository should be provided to us as a zip file or similar.  You should provide details of how to build and test your code
